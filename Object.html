    <h2>This Land Is Your Land</h2>
    <h3>by Woody Guthrle</h3>
    <p>This land is your land This land is my land<br>From California to the New York island;<br>From the red wood forest to the Gulf Strean waters<br>This land was made for you and me.</p>
    <p>As I was walking that ribbon of highway,<br>I saw above me that endless skyway:<br>I saw below me that golden valley:<br>This land was made for you and me.</p>
    <p>I've roamed and ramble and I followed my footsteps<br>To the sparking sands of her diamond deserts;<br>And all around me a voice was sounding:<br>This land was made for you and me.</p>
    <p>When the sun came shining,and I was strolling,<br>And the wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling,<br>As the fog was lifting a voice was chanting:<br>This land was made for you and me.</p>
    <p>As I went walking I saw a sign there<br> And on the sign it said <q>No Trespassing.</q><br>But on the other side it didn't say nothing,<br>That side was made for you and me.</p>
    <p>In the shadow of the steeple I saw my people,<br>By the relief office I seen my people;<br>As they stood there hungry,I stood there asking<br>Is this land made for you and me?</p>
    <p>Nobody living can ever stop me,<br>As I go walking that freedom highway;<br>Nobody living can ever make me turn back<br>This land was made for you and me.</p>
