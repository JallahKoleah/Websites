	<h1> Block-Level Elements </h1>
	<h2> Text in a preformatted Element </h2>
	<pre> This            text
	            
		    spans                 several
	     lines


	                       and                    has            lots
	of         extra

     whitespace. </pre>

	<p>The preformatted element keeps the spaces between words the way they are written in the text </p>

	<h2> Same Text in a Paragraph Element </h2>
	<p> This text spans several lines and has lots ot extra whitespace.</P>
	<p> The paragraph element ignores all the spaces between words.It only puts one space between each words instead of putting many spaces as it's shown above.</p>

	<div> This is just a brief history about the D.Twe memorial high school in the new kru town community. The D.Twe memorial high school former called(Tubman High) is a school that was estsblishe in the year 1975 by former president William VS Tubman of the republic of Liberia.

		<br> The D.twe high school has been running since her year of establishement and has also been having qualify and train instructors with bachelor degree, masters degree, PHD holders and many more that are well qualify to teach the various subjects.
The D.twe memorial high school is such an excellent of both academics and of moral.This school don't any applicant who doesn't have such degree has was listed above most especially people with high school degrees are not eligable to teach because it's a high school.</div>

	<p> The two paragraphs above that are inside the division element doesn't show any sign of visible change(s) to the page for putting the paragraphs inside the divisiion elements, so I think they both may have similar function.
