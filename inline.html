    <h1>Inline Elements</h1>
    <p>Inline elements are used to markup text inside a block element like a paragraph or division. Each element does different things to the text.
    <strong>This is a strong element. <b>This text is in a bold (b) element.</b></strong>Bold and strong seem to have the same effect.<em>This is emphasised (em) text</em>.It seems to have the same as <i>this italicized text here.</i>

    <p> Putting text inside quote elements,<q>Like this quoted text here,</q>makes the text display with quotation marks around it. Code (code) tags are meant for source code examples.They look like <code>code text here</code>. The keyboard element (kbd) looks the same,<kbd>keyboard text here,</kbd> but is meant for examples of user enter data.</p>
    <p>Superscript and subscript elements do what they say.<sup>this is superscript</sup> and <sub>this is subscript.</sub></p>
    <p>Span elemens don't seem to do anything at all.I've put about every other inside span tags.<span>Can you tell which is which?</span></p>
